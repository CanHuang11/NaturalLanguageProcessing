Suppose we have some text in the form of sentences or paragraph and we want to perform some 
operations upon those text like text classification, text summarization etc. The algorithm which we
will apply to perform these tasks will work mainly on numbers not directly on words or sentences.
So we need to convert all these different text into an intermediate representation or a model and 
then we can feed that model to some algorithm to do any kind of analysis. This repository contains
three such models to represent text. 

This repository also contains two simple projects i.e. text classification and text summarization.
